    "description": "<p>Evolution is a process that results in heritable changes in a population spread over many generations. This process is central to the understanding of how species have changed over time and adapted to their environments.</p><p>It is a foundational concept in biology and is crucial in explaining the diversity of life on Earth. From tiny microorganisms to massive mammals, evolution plays a pivotal role in shaping life forms.</p><p>Understanding the basics of evolution helps in grasping more complex topics in biology, genetics, and anthropology. It provides a framework for understanding the history of life on Earth and predicting future evolutionary changes.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Natural selection is the process by which certain traits become more common in a population due to their positive effects on an individual's reproductive success. It is one of the main mechanisms of evolution.</p><p>First proposed by Charles Darwin, the concept of natural selection suggests that traits that enhance an organism's ability to survive and reproduce will tend to spread in the population. On the other hand, traits that hinder survival and reproduction will become less common.</p><p>Over time, this leads to the adaptation of populations to their environments and can result in the emergence of new species.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Genetic drift refers to the random changes in allele frequencies within a population. Unlike natural selection, which favors certain traits, genetic drift does not act on traits' adaptiveness.</p><p>It's especially pronounced in smaller populations where chance events can lead to some alleles becoming more common while others decrease or even disappear. This can result in reduced genetic diversity.</p><p>Genetic drift can have significant evolutionary consequences, especially when combined with other factors like selection, migration, and mutation.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Mutations are random changes in the DNA sequence of an organism. They can arise from errors during DNA replication or from environmental factors like radiation and chemicals.</p><p>Most mutations are neutral, having no effect on an organism's fitness. However, some mutations can be beneficial or harmful. Beneficial mutations can increase an individual's chances of survival and reproduction, while harmful ones can decrease these chances.</p><p>Over time, mutations can lead to genetic variation within populations, which is essential for evolution. They serve as a raw material on which natural selection can act.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Bottleneck Effect describes a sharp reduction in the size of a population due to environmental events, such as earthquakes, floods, fires, or other catastrophic phenomena.</p><p>When such events occur, they can drastically reduce the numbers in a population, leading to a loss in genetic variation. This means that the genes of the survivors become disproportionately common, leading to a less diverse genetic makeup for the future generations. As the population recovers and expands, the genetic structure will be different than the original population's.</p><p>Understanding the bottleneck effect is crucial for conservation efforts, as a lack of genetic diversity can make populations more susceptible to diseases and other external threats.</p>",

The new colony may have different genetic variations than the original population due to the limited number of individuals that participated in the initial split.</p><p>Because the new population starts with just a few individuals, their unique genetic makeup becomes amplified in subsequent generations. Over time, certain traits may become more prevalent due to chance rather than because of adaptation or fitness.</p><p>Understanding the founder effect is essential in evolutionary biology and population genetics, as it demonstrates the random nature of genetic drift and its influence on shaping genetic variation within populations.</p>",
